  <h1 class="title">Metaphor & Metonymy</h1>

  <div class="main">

    <h2 class="Header">Definition</h2>
    <h4>
      <strong>Metaphor</strong> is a type of figurative language in which a word or phrase
      is compared to another in a non-literal but symbolic way, such that understanding <br>
      one concept is prompted by another. Metaphors can be used as a mechanism for forming
      new words.
      <br><br>

      <strong>Metonymy</strong> occurs when an object or idea takes the place of another
      with which it has a close association or related meaning. Like metaphor, metonymy
      can also function as a strategy in word formation.

    <h2 class="Header">Characterization</h2>
    <h4>
      Metaphors are a common lexical tool used to achieve figurative speech. They have
      existed in the lexicon for such a long period of time that an entire subcategory,
      known as <em>dead metaphors</em>, has developed. These are worn-out or overused
      metaphors, often related to the human body (Katamba 179). Examples include
      <em>leg of a table</em>, <em>eye of a needle</em>, <em>foot of a mountain</em>, and
      <em>tongue of a shoe</em> (Katamba 179).
      <br><br>

      Despite the prevalence of dead metaphors, speakers continue to innovate new
      metaphors that reflect social and cultural change. For example, <em>banana skin</em>
      emerged in British political discourse to describe a political misadventure that
      causes a public and humiliating failure (Katamba 179). Similarly, <em>fruit salad</em>
      has come to mean a combination of narcotics, and <em>to be gutted</em> metaphorically
      expresses emotional devastation by drawing on the physical act of gutting a fish
      (Katamba 179).
      <br><br>

      Metaphors are productive in word formation because the lexicon is able to use
      tangible, concrete entities to conceptualize abstract or theoretical ideas.
      <br><br>

      Metonymy functions by replacing one word or phrase (the target) with another closely
      related word or phrase (the vehicle) (Basilio 69). For instance, <em>silver screen</em>
      serves as a metonym for film, as early movies were projected onto screens and silver
      references the black-and-white coloring of early cinema ("Metonymy"). Other common
      examples include <em>white collar</em> for corporate employees and <em>the crown</em>
      for royalty.
      <br><br>

      Metonymy is an efficient tool for word formation because the lexicon acts as a system
      for storing symbols rather than isolated concepts (Basilio 69–70). As linguist
      George Lakoff argues, humans can mentally access one conceptual entity through another,
      allowing the lexicon to store fewer but more interconnected concepts (Basilio 70).
      This cognitive mechanism enables the consistent formation of metonyms.
      <br><br>

      Metonyms are also commonly used to refer to creators through their creations. Saying
      someone owns a <em>Rembrandt</em> refers to a painting by Rembrandt, and asking
      “Have you heard the new <em>Taylor Swift</em>?” refers to her most recent music.
      <br><br>

      Additionally, metonymy is frequently employed to soften taboo or socially sensitive
      language. Metonymic euphemisms replace harsh or inappropriate expressions with more
      neutral phrasing (Tokar 237). In these cases, a single intended word is often replaced
      by a longer descriptive phrase.
      <br><br>

      Metaphors and metonyms often appear as compounds, and the distinction between the two
      lies primarily in relatability. Metaphor compares two unrelated concepts, while
      metonymy replaces one concept with another that is closely related. However, the two
      processes can interact.
      <br><br>

      Some linguists argue that metaphors can exist within metonyms and vice versa (Benczes
      182). For example, in <em>hammerhead</em>, the hammer metaphorically compares two
      unrelated hard entities—the tool and a stubborn person’s head—while the compound
      itself functions metonymically as a label for a stubborn individual (Benczes 182).
      <br><br>

      Linguist Louis Goossens coined the term <em>metaphtonymy</em> to describe this overlap
      between metaphor and metonymy (Benczes 183). An example is the idiom
      <em>to beat one’s breast</em>, which metonymically refers to public confession or
      remorse, while also being metaphorically extended into secular contexts, such as
      expressing agony over a sports loss (Benczes 183).
