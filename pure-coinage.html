    <h2 class="Header">Definition</h2>
    <h4>
      A word formation process in which a new word is created without the use of other word
      formation processes. New coinage words are truly original and previously non-existent.
    </h4>

    <h2 class="Header">Characterization</h2>
    <h4>
      Coinage is the rarest word formation process. It is much more productive (and simpler) in
      English to create new words from familiar morphemes. However, media, advertisers, and product
      marketers utilize coinage to propel their products and content in front of their competition.
      Thus, a majority of coined words are product names that become general terms. An example of
      this is Aspirin. This of course is a brand name for a painkiller but has become so commonly
      used in the speech community that people often refer to painkillers in general as Aspirin.
      <br><br>

      Similarly, coinage words from popular fictional movies and books can make their way into
      mainstream culture. For example, the adored book series Harry Potter written by J.K. Rowling
      generated the word muggle, which means a non-magical person. Notice the novelty of the word
      muggle. There isn't phonological match in the existing lexicon nor one that is spelled the
      same. The morphemes involved are not derived from other words therefor there is no other word
      formation process at work.
      <br><br>

      For example, "uggle" does not come from "juggle" or "mug" does not mean to rob someone, so
      blending is not at play. There is no former meaning of the word muggle so conversion is not at
      play, and so on and so forth.
      <br><br>

      When a new word enters the theoretical atmosphere, its life expectancy is unknown. The
      survival of the new word is dependent on its acceptance by the speech community (Štekauer
      98). A new word that is used once and is never institutionalized is called a nonce word
      (Štekauer 98). Think of these as would-be coinages that died in their infancy. These are not
      to be confused with pure coinage words.
      <br><br>

      Also, the term neologism can be confused with coinage. A neologism is any new word that is
      institutionalized within a speech community, no matter the word formation process used
      (Štekauer 98). Brexit (blending), watchability (affixation), and simmed (clipping) are all
      examples of neologisms but not of coinage. Pure coinage words can be neologisms but not all
      neologisms derived from pure coinage.
