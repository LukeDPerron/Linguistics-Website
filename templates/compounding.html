    <h2 class="Header">Definition</h2>
    <h4>
      A method of word formation in which two bases combine to form a new lexical item.
      The two bases may exist as independent words.<br>
      In other words, compounding creates a new morpheme from two otherwise free morphemes.
    </h4>

    <h2 class="Header">Characterization</h2>
    <h4>
      Compounding and affixation can work together in word formation. A base in a compound
      may be affixed to the new lexical item to give it verb-hood, noun-hood, or other
      grammatical functions (Katamba 67).
      Most compounds are compound nouns, though compound verbs, adjectives, and adverbs
      also exist. One notable phonological feature of compounds is stress placement:
      stress typically falls on the first element of the compound rather than the second.
      <br><br>

      For example:<br>
      the <em>`White 'house</em> vs. a <em>'white `house</em>
      <br><br>

      In the compound <em>White House</em>, stress falls on the first element, whereas in
      the phrase <em>white house</em>, stress falls on the second element (Katamba 68).
      Similar contrasts can be seen in pairs such as <em>wet suit</em>, <em>hot dog</em>,
      and <em>black bird</em> (Katamba 68).
      <br><br>

      In English, most compounds are <em>headed</em>, meaning that the syntactic category
      of the compound is determined by one of its bases—typically the second base
      (Katamba 67).
      <br><br>

      For example, <em>blackberry</em> is composed of the adjective <em>black</em> and the
      noun <em>berry</em>. Since <em>berry</em> heads the compound, <em>blackberry</em> is
      a noun (Katamba 67).
      <br><br>

      The second base also functions as the semantic head. The first base serves as a
      descriptor or specifier. In <em>shoestring</em>, both bases are nouns, but <em>shoe</em>
      describes the type of string rather than the compound referring to a shoe.

      Compounds with semantic heads are known as <em>endocentric compounds</em>. Compounds
      without semantic heads are called <em>exocentric compounds</em>. For instance,
      <em>egghead</em> does not refer to a type of head, but to an intellectually inclined
      person—there is no semantic head in this compound.
      <br><br>

      Another classification distinguishes <em>root compounds</em> from
      <em>synthetic compounds</em>.

      In root compounds (also called primary compounds), the head is not derived from a
      verb. The most common and productive type is the noun + noun construction, such as
      <em>doghouse</em>, <em>strawberry</em>, and <em>airplane</em>.

      In synthetic compounds, the head is deverbal and functions as a verb, while the
      first element acts as its object (Nordquist). Synthetic compounding combines both
      derivation and compounding.

      Examples include:<br>
      noun + verb-er: <em>dishwasher</em>, <em>watchmaker</em><br>
      noun + verb-ing: <em>housekeeping</em>, <em>letter-writing</em>
