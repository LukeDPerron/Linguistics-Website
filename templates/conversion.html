    <h2 class="Header">Definition</h2>
    <h4>
      The transition of a word from one part of speech to another part of speech.
    </h4>

    <h2 class="Header">Characterization</h2>
    <h4>
      Conversion is also known as <em>zero derivation</em>. In this type of word formation,
      there is no change in the shape of the input base (Katamba 64). The only alteration
      the word undergoes is a semantic shift in its lexical categorization.
      <br><br>

      Conversion of nouns into verbs and verbs into nouns is highly productive in English
      (Katamba 64). Because the word form remains unchanged, grammatical context is often
      the only way to determine the word’s part of speech (Katamba 64). In the example
      below, <em>like</em> functions as both a noun and a verb. In its noun usage, the word
      undergoes conversion through zero derivation—no affix is added—demonstrating a key
      trait of conversion (Katamba 65).
      <br><br>

      Although verb-to-noun and noun-to-verb conversions are the most common, adjectives
      and adverbs can also undergo conversion. For instance, the word <em>stupid</em> can
      function as both an adjective and a noun without any change in form.
