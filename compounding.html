        <h2 class="Header">Definition</h2>
        <h4>A method of word formation where two bases combine to form a new lexical item.
         The two bases may be words independently.<br> In other words, compounding creates a new morpheme from two otherwise free morphemes. </h4>
        <h2 class="Header">Characterization</h2>
        <h4>
          Most commonly, source words belong to the same syntactic category (e.g., noun + noun),
          although blends from different syntactic categories do exist (Beliaeva 5).
          Source words—the independent words that merge to form the blend—often share
          phonological or graphical similarities (Beliaeva 3).
          The most common pattern in English blending involves taking the first part of the
          first source word and combining it with the second part of the second source word
          (Beliaeva 13). An example of this is <em>frenemy</em>, formed from <em>friend</em> and
          <em>enemy</em>.
          <br><br>
          Although there is no strict rule governing blend formation, several common factors
          influence the ordering of source words:
          <br><br>

          • <strong>Length of source words</strong> (shorter word comes first):<br>
          stay + vacation → <em>staycation</em>
          <br><br>

          • <strong>Frequency</strong> (more frequently used word comes first):<br>
          emotion + icon → <em>emoticon</em>
          <br><br>

          • <strong>Prototypicality</strong> (more prototypical word comes first):<br>
          spoon + fork → <em>spork</em>
          <br><br>

          • <strong>Pragmatics</strong> (order of real-world events):<br>
          breakfast + lunch → <em>brunch</em> (Beliaeva 8)
          <br><br>

          Phonological convenience and spelling also influence blend formation, though these
          factors are difficult to define precisely. However, blend types themselves are easier
          to categorize.
          The three most widely accepted types of blending are <strong>phonemic overlap</strong>,
          <strong>clipping</strong>, and a combination of <strong>overlap and clipping</strong>
          (Hosseinzadeh 19).
          <strong>Overlap</strong> occurs when a syllable or part of a syllable is shared between
          both source words, allowing the shared element to function in the new blend
          (Hosseinzadeh 19). For example, <em>slanguage</em> combines <em>slang</em> and
          <em>language</em>, which share the syllable <em>lang</em> (Hosseinzadeh 20).
          <br><br>

          Other overlap examples include:<br>
          sex + expert → <em>sexpert</em><br>
          alcohol + holiday → <em>alcoholiday</em>
          <br><br>

          <strong>Clipping</strong>, the most common blending technique, removes part of one or
          more source words. The most frequent form is <em>back clipping</em>, where the front of
          the word is retained (Hosseinzadeh 19).
          <br><br>

          Other forms include:<br>
          • <em>Fore clipping</em> (retaining the back of the word), as in <em>chute</em> from
          <em>parachute</em><br>
          • <em>Middle clipping</em>, as in <em>fridge</em> from <em>refrigerator</em>
          (Hosseinzadeh 20)
          <br><br>

          Some blends use both overlap and clipping simultaneously. An example is
          <em>pomato</em>, formed from <em>potato</em> and <em>tomato</em>.
          The shared syllable <em>ato</em> overlaps both words, while <em>potato</em> is back
          clipped to <em>po</em> and <em>tomato</em> is middle clipped to <em>om</em>
          (Hosseinzadeh 23).
